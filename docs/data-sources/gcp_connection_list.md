# ciphertrust_gcp_connection_list (Data Source)

The GCP data source in this Terraform provider retrieves details of existing ciphertrust_gcp_connection resource. It supports filtering based on attributes such as name and id.


<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Optional

- `filters` (Map of String)

### Read-Only

- `gcp` (Attributes List) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--gcp))

<a id="nestedatt--gcp"></a>
### Nested Schema for `gcp`

Read-Only:

- `cloud_name` (String)
- `description` (String)
- `id` (String)
- `key_file` (String)
- `labels` (Map of String)
- `meta` (Map of String)
- `name` (String)
- `products` (List of String)

### Fetch an existing gcp connection using `filters`

    data "ciphertrust_gcp_connection_list" "example_gcp_connection" {
       filters = {
          labels = "env=dev"
       }
    }

This retrieves the GCP connection filtered by the specified labels from the CipherTrust Manager.
Instead of labels, you can also use name,id or similar identifier to fetch the gcp connection.

If you didn't pass any filters, then terraform will fetch all the gcp connections in the CipherTrust Manager.
