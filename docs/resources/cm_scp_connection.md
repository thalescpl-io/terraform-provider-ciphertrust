# ciphertrust_cm_scp_connection (Resource)

The SCP resource in this Terraform provider enables configuring Secure Copy Protocol (SCP) connections for secure file transfers, such as backups, to external servers. Supported authentication methods are key and password. For key, download the public key via the scp/publickey API and add it to the destination host's authorized keys. For password, provide the destination host's password. Additionally, specify the host's public key for verification, typically located in /etc/ssh/ on the destination machine.
